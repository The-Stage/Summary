Believe us or not,  what you are about to read is what we, your friends,  really 
think you are. 

You are kind and brilliant. Mostly calm and peaceful, you are the one rushing to 
ask what wrong with you friends or beloved one. You are the one suggesting many 
solution to their problems. Even if you have no solution for tem,  you are usually 
on their side for support. 

You're skillful and aware of it. No matter the situation and how it evolves, you 
always lead it the right way to reach success. You're tireless when it is to 
give a help. Yes,  sometimes you are exhausted and want to rest. But you always 
find energy for the one that matter to you.

You're humble and patient. Your patience is limitless. You're able to keep 
listening for hours without shouting stop! Indeed, listening is such a great 
skill. Your humility is just awesome.

Yes, it happens those moments you want to speak to nobody. Moments you want to 
be alone. Moment you want to listen nobody but to be listened. Moments you're 
sad and want a silent shoulder to cry on. Moments you want to run away from 
everything to find peace. Those moments are all good.  That's life. 

Thanks for being so charming and careful about us. 
Thanks for being a good friend. 
Thanks for everything single effort you're doing for us. 

You're great, brilliant,  damn attractive, charming, cool, thoughtful, .... 
You're amazing. Don't let nobody tell you the opposite.
