## Chapter One

Sitting in a room looking around me, the only things I could notice were bottles, cooking pot, oil can, chair, cup. The room is actually almost empty. The wall was painted in bleue and door build with wood. No paint on the door. The lock was rusted.

I was inside with the door closed. Hold on; I just awaken in that room, I don't even know how I fell in. Trying to get out, It was impossible. I shake so hard the door that the key broken. I was locked inside then, no way to go out.

At that moment I've been thinking to break the door to go out, nature remind me my weakness (not so strong it seems). Suddenly, I heard a noise behind. Was I in trouble?

Developing a myopia, I can't see far away without my glasses. My glasses was at 5 meters about from me.

I can see that glow in my back. I was thrilled; I can feel - I don't know how to explain that - like a wave going from my feet to my head. What was there? I start thinking that I wasn't alone. I figure out that, the room was way much bigger than I thought. Reaching my glasses in a haste, I saw a dark snake right in font of it. Accepting all risk, because without my glasses I was anyway in trouble and a big mess, I gently hang my hand and pick quickly my glasses and roll off. And then begin my exploration of that scary room to find my way out.

Everything was so hermetically close that only one hole in a corner of the room brings light inside. Now that I have my glasses set rightly on my face, my vision is quite clear. My fear was so great that I was already shaking while walking. I double check everything in my pocket. I was looking for my cell phone. But, nothing to do with it - It wasn't there. My white shirt - my girlfirend just gave me as a present - was completely dirty and it's right sleeve's was torn up. I can imagine how she will look after me seing it in this state. Anyway, the situation don't really let me thing about all those details. Going out of that room is my first objective. Everything else is secondary.

On my right side I saw a door ajar. On my left hand though was a long hallway. Which one to choose? What was I going to see at each? Too many questions start dangling in my head - I was sweating, it is really hot inside indeed -. Form the other side of the hallway, I heard some low noise; like whispering. I then decided to face my fear like a man and choose to go through the corridor. My heart start beating so fastly that I could heard it in my hear. One foot in front of the other, I came closer and closer to the noise. On my way in the corridor, it was at each side, old dirty doors all closed. I was too much afraid to open all of them. But the noise was comming from the antepenult. As I was touching the door, it opened immediately. So, I could see that huge, dark and sleeping dog. His size make me think of a hunting dog. I was trembling of fear. I used my left hand to shut my mounth - preventing myselft of crying - and hide my breathing. Any brusque movement could awaken that dog; and that is my last whish.

I pull back carefully and patiently the door and continue my way; hoping that I could find an exit as soon as possible. After exactly 7 steps - yes I'm counting my steps; listenning around; smelling and keeping my eye big opened - I was in a big room. It seems like a living room but not livable no more. There were dust everywhere. One more step and I could leave remarquable footprint on the ground; and that is bad for me - It is only then that I noticed that I was barefoot -. Staying on my feet, I look carefully around. The two windows I saw was condemned with solid iron beam. This room look abandoned for a very long time. I get it late; It seems like I choose the wrong direction. No way out by here. A big sweat rool off from my forehead. I have to back off and check the former direction.

I was walking back quite fastly. Then, the dog's door start opening slowly with a creaking. I stop immediately and hold my breath with the intention not to breath again - I haven't do as good as that even during my swimming exercises -. After fifteen long seconds, I have a glance in the room and see the dog still sleeping; "lucky you this time", I said. I then speed up my walk and reach my initial room. I open the door ajar and, all dark. No light, I couldn' see 5 centimeters in front of myself. It was like an outage voltage inside my head. I could feel my fear growing up and my mind in alert. I could feel the danger around me and being aware of that is more scary.

I went on my knees to try to find anything - I wasn't thinking rationnaly of course -  to help me out. Tasting the ground with my hands, I felt wastes under my fingers. I could feel as well ants, cockroachs or may be it was differents insects. I can't really rely on my touch to identify insects. I found a nail somewhere as well. And then the picture of the black snake I saw earlier go through my mind; I suddenly got up and come back to my woodmade door. I tried to push the nail over the lock so hardly but trying not to make too much noise to awake that dog sleeping over there. Suddenly the door opened an I could feel a wave of fresh air fondle my face. Stepping out of that strange house, I understand that, this is just the begining of my trouble. It seems like I'm in nowhere in a forest. As long as I can rely on my sight, there are trees everywhere around. I don't know my current position, I don't get a map. I don't have a compass. I don't even know what is going on here. What a crazy situation?
