Sometimes we do things and we don't even know why. 

Sometimes we get confused and we don't understand our own decisions. 

Sometimes we hold the truth and decided to not believe it. 

Sometimes we feel laziness even if we are really motivated to get the job done. 

Sometimes we get feeling we do no understand or maybe that we shouldn't have. 

Sometimes we get no answers to our questions. 

Sometimes we are just exhausted because of thinking too much.

Sometimes we seems on so bad mood that we miss the best part of life. 

Sometimes we need a little bit of hope. A pitch of help to start roaring and 
shinning.

You know what,  life is so fast. Take a break and breath deeply. You deserved it. 
Then tackle one by one things that really matter to you. We are not build to multitask.
Mono task as much as possible and keep track of time.  It could help you get stuff done. 

Fellings are quite difficult to handle. When you get fussy fellings, a little bit of introspection could help you out.
