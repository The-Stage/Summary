Have you ever felt overwhelm by feelings that make your heart melt. feelings 
that make your heart ache?

Have you ever been submerged by feelings that do no belong to you? 

In one day,  so many things can happen. Some of those things fortify our person 
and make us grown up intellectually, psychologically and physically. Other things 
drawn out our energy and make us feel tired while doing less.

And then happen the moment where we have no reference. We are like suspended to something or someone by our emotions. We are completely left out and without explanation of what is happening. We are literally like floating in the air purposeless.

What ever we have in our mind as a goal to reach is then blurred. Suddenly, we are strengthless. We feel exhausted and all we wish is to lay down on a bed and close our eye. We just want to turn off "the machine" and restart it fresh and clean. We want a break.

Have you ever felt that indescribable state of mind and feelings?

Those are one of the moments I dislike the most in a day. I like to keep control of what happen and when it happens. I would like to hold the button to switch on and off my feelings or emotions. 

To jump over those "not defined" state of mind, stop talking and observe things around you without judgement. Don't analyse,  don't think. Just breath and look.
