# The Stage

The stage is an English learning platform based on thematics. Managed by learner, 
the content provided by `The Stage` will grow up quickly. For the sake of learning, 
each member of `The Stage` will write at a certain moment some content which will 
be published online of the Stage platform.

## Introduction

I want to learn, I want to improve my english skills and I want to spread my knowledge.
Learning is a process we go through from childhood to adulte. We are all born with a gift. 
The ability to learn what we want. In the enfance, we don't really use it consciensly. 
We learn language quite passively and develop some habit without being aware of it.

While growing up, we start being aware of many thing. We ask a lot of questions. We develop 
curiosity. Who remember when he is told not to touch something or not going somewhere. 
Generaly we do that thing or go to that place to know what is going on there. 
Being curious and learn is part of our personality.

Now, *why not use all our consiousness to do something useful for us?* 
The Stage aim to help you out with your desire to learn english. But 
the big deals many person encounter when learning new language are: `motivation` and `perseverance`.

Many person get ennoyed quickly. When they start something new, they are really motivated. After two, three weeks 
that motivation start `falling down` and after one month they are `not learning` any more. 
So it is important to keep you motivated and fresh every single day to learn continuously.

Hold on for a moment! Take two minutes and think about your day. *What do you usually do?* 
What is your hobbit? The most interresting you have to look after is what you have fun to do.
What you can do without being tired (humm, for that, it is arguable).

The Stage brings your hobbits in your learning process. And so you can learn while 
having fun. As english learning include `grammar`, `vocabulary`, `writing` and `speaking`, 
you will be told to write about your hobbits, **to take the stage** and **share your knowledge** 
with everybody.

## Schedule

A language learning process need dayly practice. And so:

- Every day, fifteen minutes of conversation will be organized online

- Every Wednesday and Sunday, two hours of discussion around a choosen topics online. 
A leader which prepare the topic will hold the Stage as an expert. For any question 
he/she will be the reference. So the leader have to master his topic. Don't worry, all life 
is a long learning process. We won't ask you the impossible or ask for the moon.

- Every two weeks, on Saturday, we will organize a sitting. A leader will take the stage
and dazzle (funny, serious, focused, motivating, etc.) the group. 
This will be our speaking practice time.

After every stage, discussion, a summary of what to remember will be hosted online in 
a `git repository` and serves as a static web site. So you can checkout anything out 
when you need it.

## Diaries

It could be useful to write down what happen in your life on a daily bases. 
Holding a diary is a creative way to grow quickly your vocabulary. Then, you 
acquire the ability to express what you do on a daily bases and use that knowledge 
as a background to build a very huge vocabulary in different area. The thing is:

 > We always extend our knowledge from what we already know. It is complicated to 
 learn new things with out any background.

The stage support you all along your learning process and can help you out to 
publish on a `blog` by example on your desire.


**The stage is yours!**
